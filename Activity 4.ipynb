    "### **Data Analytics Task: Customer Feedback Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "You work as a data analyst for a company that collects customer feedback across several service categories, including Timeliness, Quality, and Customer Support. Each feedback entry includes a customer ID, the service category, and a rating from 1 to 5 (where 5 is the highest level of satisfaction). Your task is to analyze this feedback to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "- Calculate the average rating for each service category.\n",
    "- Identify the service category with the highest and lowest average rating.\n",
    "- Determine the distribution of ratings for each category (how many 1s, 2s, etc.).\n",
    "- Suggest actionable insights based on the analysis."
